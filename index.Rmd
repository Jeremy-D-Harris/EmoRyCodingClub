# Before you arrive:

* Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) from CRAN. 
  + If you're asked to choose a CRAN mirror, just choose whichever is closest to your location.
* Install [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Install the `tidyverse` package and then load it by copying and pasting the following code into the *Console* of RStudio and then pressing *Enter* to execute it.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


<br>


# Pre-work questions
If you you have no previous experience with R or coding, then before arriving please complete the pre-work below to get familiar with a few basic things about the R Studio IDE and coding in R. The exercise below should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

Once you have installed R and R Studio, copy and paste the code below into the R Studio *Console* and press *Enter* to run it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Caculate something simple
2 + 2

# Calculate something using built-in contants
2*pi

```

<br>

Use the *assignment operator*, `<-`, to create new objects in R

```{r, eval = FALSE}

a <- 2 + 2
b <- a*pi
c <- "Hello World"
```

And then print the objects in the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a 
b
c
```


# Learning Objectives

Our first EmoRy Coding Club will be primarily targeted towards beginners, but we hope this will also useful for anyone who may already be familiar with base R but would like to get better practice with the R `tidyverse`.

1) Introducing beginners to the RStudio IDE
2) Doing some introductory plotting with `ggplot`

We will use the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) free online text to guide us through learning R.

# Materials

We'll be diving into [Ch 3, Data visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and will work through Section 3.3.1.

```{r, echo =FALSE, }
# devtools::install_github('yihui/xfun')

# a single RmD file
# xfun::embed_file('example.Rmd')

 # r xfun::embed_file('example.Rmd')`  
 # r xfun::embed_file('data.csv')` 

```
