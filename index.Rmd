## Overview    
This page contains all the documents, links, and information for the monthly `R` coding club held in the Department of Biology, Emory University. We meet monthly and introduce new coding concepts and techniques in a casual working environment. The club is half lesson half workshop style and caters for all coding, `R`, and research levels.  
  
```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# klippy::klippy()
```

<!-- rmd settings -->
```{r, set-options, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
options(width=100)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
 eval = TRUE, # run all code
 # echo = FALSE, # show code chunks in output 
 comment = "",
 tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=100), # set width of code chunks in output
 tidy=TRUE, # make output as tidy
 message = FALSE,  # mask all messages
 warning = FALSE, # mask all warnings 
 size="small", # set code chunk size
 knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = 'H')
)
```


<!-- install packages -->
```{r, load packages, include=T, cache=F, message=F, warning=F, results='hide',echo=F}
packages <- c("ggplot2","dplyr","tidyverse","zoo","RColorBrewer","viridis","plyr","leaflet")   
if (require(packages)) {
    install.packages(packages,dependencies = T)
    require(packages)
}
lapply(packages,library,character.only=T)
```

## Date for next session  
July 11, 2019    
04:00 - 6:00 PM     
\  

## Location   
Rm 2052  
Wayne O. Rollins Building  
\  

```{r,echo=F}
require(leaflet)
latlon <- c(33.79667, -84.32346) # emory
ecc_label <- "Room 2052 \nWayne Rollins Research Building"
map <- leaflet() # initiate the leaflet map object
map <- addTiles(map) # add the actual map tiles to the leaflet object
map <- addMarkers(map,latlon[2],latlon[1],label=ecc_label,popup=ecc_label) # generate some random data around lat/lon 35
map 

```

# Before you arrive:

* Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) from CRAN. 
  + If you're asked to choose a CRAN mirror, just choose whichever is closest to your location.
* Install [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Install the `tidyverse` package and then load it by copying and pasting the following code into the *Console* of RStudio and then pressing *Enter* to execute it.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


<br>


# Pre-work questions
If you you have no previous experience with R or coding, then before arriving please complete the pre-work below to get familiar with a few basic things about the R Studio IDE and coding in R. The exercise below should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

Once you have installed R and R Studio, copy and paste the code below into the R Studio *Console* and press *Enter* to run it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Caculate something simple
2 + 2

# Calculate something using built-in contants
2*pi

```

<br>

Use the *assignment operator*, `<-`, to create new objects in R

```{r, eval = FALSE}

a <- 2 + 2
b <- a*pi
c <- "Hello World"
```

And then print the objects in the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a 
b
c
```


# Learning Objectives

Our first EmoRy Coding Club will be primarily targeted towards beginners, but we hope this will also useful for anyone who may already be familiar with base R but would like to get better practice with the R `tidyverse`.

1) Introducing beginners to the RStudio IDE
2) Doing some introductory plotting with `ggplot`

We will use the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) free online text to guide us through learning R.

![R for Data Science book](https://github.com/darwinanddavis/EmoRyCodingClub/raw/master/docs/img/cover.png).

# Materials

We'll be diving into [Ch 3, Data visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and will work through Section 3.3.1.

```{r, echo =FALSE, }
# devtools::install_github('yihui/xfun')

# a single RmD file
# xfun::embed_file('example.Rmd')

# embed a single csv file
 # r xfun::embed_file('data.csv')` 

```
